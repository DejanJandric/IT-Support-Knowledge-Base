# **Server troubleshooting routine**

The first step in troubleshooting server problems is to determine whether the physical layer is functioning properly. This includes the server computer hardware, any attached peripherals, and the cabling. Switching out network cards or cables will help you identify whether the hardware is at fault. For testing long runs of cable that can’t be easily switched, use a cable tester or multimeter.

If you have recently added new hardware to the server, make sure that it’s compatible with the operating system.

**Server Troubleshooting addressing and routing problems**

Once hardware issues are ruled out, the next step is to verify the operating system configuration. Most business networks rely on TCP/IP, and incorrect TCP/IP settings can lead to addressing or routing issues.

Ensure the server’s TCP/IP configuration is accurate. These settings can sometimes change unexpectedly, such as during an application installation. A common issue occurs when a server’s TCP/IP settings are reset, making it a DHCP client. Typically, servers should use static IP addresses. While the problem might not immediately affect file or print servers, incorrect settings on a DNS server or domain controller can cause client connectivity issues.

**Troubleshooting name resolution problems**

A name carries significant importance when computers communicate because names must be resolved to IP addresses. If you encounter a connectivity issue, test the connection by pinging another system using both its name and IP address. If the server fails to communicate using the host name but connects successfully via IP address, review its DNS configuration, WINS settings, and the HOSTS and LMHOSTS files.

**Troubleshooting application problems**

Applications installed on servers differ from the productivity software commonly found on workstations. Server applications are typically designed to manage, maintain, or monitor the server, such as disk utilities, network monitoring tools, or packet sniffers. They may also provide additional server services, like proxy server software installed over the operating system.

Ensuring compatibility with the underlying operating system is critical. Programs like Microsoft’s Certified for Windows 2000 program can help verify the compatibility of server applications. On a Windows server, check the application log under Start → Programs → Administrative Tools → Event Viewer for any application-related errors.

**Troubleshooting print server problems**

Printing problems can originate from several places: the printer attached to the print server, the print server’s configuration, the connections linking printer and server or server and network, and the client’s configuration.


Begin troubleshooting by confirming that the printer is operational and all connections are secure. Ensure the correct printer drivers are installed. Check that the print spooler service is running and verify there is enough disk space on the server for spooling. Review the printer permissions, and, if using a Windows 2000 or .NET domain, examine group policy settings related to printers.

**Troubleshooting e-mail server problems**

Email is the most widely used network application today. Issues with the mail server can arise from common connectivity problems like hardware faults or incorrect TCP/IP settings. 

Additionally, check the following:
-Ensure the Mail Exchange (MX) resource records in your DNS entries are accurate. 
-Confirm that the mail server has sufficient disk space for user mailboxes, and consider setting mailbox size limits if there are many high-volume users. 
-If your mail server needs to receive mail from other servers, verify that it is configured to allow relay; otherwise, external mail requests will be blocked.

**Troubleshooting Terminal Services problems**

The “thin client” approach has gained popularity with Terminal Services integrated into Windows 2000 and .NET server operating systems. 

When troubleshooting terminal server issues, check the following:
-In a Windows 2000 or .NET domain, review group policy settings and individual user account properties in Active Directory if users have trouble connecting to the terminal server or are unexpectedly disconnected.
-Check the Terminal Services configuration from Start → Programs → Administrative Tools → Terminal Services Configuration. Ensure the terminal server is set to Application mode; otherwise, only administrators can connect and only two sessions are allowed.
-Confirm that a Terminal Services license server is set up and that enough licenses are available.

**Troubleshooting dial-up/remote access server problems**

A remote access server enables clients to connect to your network by dialing in or by using a VPN connection over the Internet. 
|
If clients can’t connect to your remote access server, first review general connectivity issues. Then, check that remote access services are installed, correctly configured, and running on the server. Ensure dial-in, PPTP, and L2TP ports are enabled for inbound remote access calls. 

Finally, verify that the remote access server accepts connections using the protocols required by the remote

**Backup Battery Unit Troubleshooting**

Power surges or outages can cause various mysterious glitches, even if your server seems unaffected. Protecting your server with a reliable Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is crucial to prevent these issues. A good UPS provides immediate backup power during outages, allowing the server to either continue running smoothly or to shut down properly, preventing data loss and hardware damage. It also protects against power surges and voltage fluctuations that can harm sensitive server components. Overall, a UPS ensures operational continuity, safeguards data integrity, and extends the lifespan of your equipment, making it an essential component in any server environment.

**Good practice and guidance**

Using VM software to mirror your server configuration provides strong disaster protection. Server clustering involves creating an exact copy of your server on a second machine. If the main server fails, the backup can immediately take over, so users face minimal or no interruption in network services. This approach helps maintain uptime and simplifies recovery from hardware or system failures.
