**Check Power**

Make sure the PC has power (sound or lights).

You can also follow these brief steps:

-Ensure that the power cable is securely plugged into both the PC and the power outlet.
-Check that the power outlet is working by plugging in a different device, such as a lamp.
-Look for any lights or indicators on the PC that show it is receiving power. For example, many PCs have a power light on the front panel that turns on when the PC is powered on.
-Press the power button on the PC to see if it turns on. If nothing happens, try holding down the power button for a few seconds to see if this initiates the power-up process.

**Check for Logo or BIOS screen**

If nothing is displayed on the screen, see if the logo screen or BIOS screen can be displayed.

If you can see the BIOS menu, this suggests that there is no problem with your power supply, and there may be a software issue. Once you enter BIOS, use the arrow keys to navigate through the BIOS menu to find the option to reset the computer to its default or factory settings.

**Check cables if using an external monitor**

-Make sure the correct cables are connected from the PC to the monitor.
-Make sure the cables are not loose.
-Make sure the power cable is firmly attached to the monitor.
-Consider trying a different monitor or cable, if available.
-Try connecting the monitor to a different PC, if more than one is available.

**Check the monitor settings**

-Make sure that the correct input source is selected on the monitor and that the display resolution and refresh rate are set correctly. See View display settings in Windows 10 and 11.
-For monitor settings, you'll need the user manual from the monitor manufacturer.

**Check Display Settings**

For general display issues, check display settings.

Right-click the desktop, choose Display settings, and see options for changing display settings.

Try setting the Display resolution to the recommended setting.

Some flickering issues may be resolved by changing the refresh rate.

Right-click the desktop, select Display settings, Advanced display settings, Display adapter properties for Display 1, and then select the Monitor tab. Select a refresh rate that is supported by the monitor.

**Update or Roll Back Drivers**

If a hardware device stops working correctly after a recent update, try updating or rolling back the driver. Open Device Manager, right-click the problematic device, and select Properties â†’ Driver tab. Choose Update Driver to search for the latest version online or Roll Back Driver if the issue began after a recent update. Restart your computer to apply the changes and verify if the device functions properly.

**Try different applications**

If the display issue occurs in a specific application, close the application, and try a different application to see if the issue still occurs. If the issue only occurs in a specific application, try checking any display settings the application might have. Check with the manufacturer of the application for any updates.
