# **Troubleshooting Keyboard and Mouse Issues**

**Unplug and Replug the Device**

First, try unplugging the problematic keyboard or mouse and then plugging it back in. This simple step can fix the issue more often than you might think. If that doesn’t work, try plugging the device into a different USB port.

**Update Your Drivers**

If unplugging and replugging doesn’t solve the problem, it might be a driver issue. Here’s how to update your drivers:

-Open Device Manager on your computer.
-Find your keyboard or mouse in the list of devices.
-Right-click on the device and select Update driver.
-Choose the option to Search automatically for drivers.
-Follow the prompts to complete the update.

**Uninstall and Reinstall the Device**

If updating the drivers doesn’t help, you can try uninstalling and then reinstalling the device:

-Open Device Manager.
-Find your keyboard or mouse in the list of devices.
-Right-click on the device and select Uninstall device.
-Restart your computer. Windows will automatically reinstall the latest drivers.

**Check Wireless Connections**

If you’re using a wireless keyboard or mouse, make sure the transceiver (the small USB dongle that comes with the device) is plugged in. Also, try changing the batteries in your devices, as low battery power can cause connectivity issues.

**Inspect for Physical Damage**

Look for any physical damage to your keyboard or mouse, such as frayed or torn wiring. Physical damage can often be the cause of issues and might require you to replace the device.
